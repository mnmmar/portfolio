I used a lot of JQuery to add a lot of content. The carousel, the mini game, the buttons' functions, and most of the pages were built with JQuery. The hardest part of the project was trying to tie up the game so that it would end once a collision had been detected. That part was so annoying but my mentor helped me through it. I feel like most of my time was spent on that stupid game. It took me a while to deploy and get onto the repository on github because I was waiting on my new computer to arrive. I'd been using my old one to code the project but wanted all the rest of the process to be done on my new mac. That was honestly super stressful because my laptop ended up getting delayed because of the hurricane and after it arrived, I had to rush to type everything in from the other computer. And thennnn I found out you can do the mac transfer to have everything moved over from one mac to another! A lot of wasted time there.
Honestly, aside from the technical things, I really need to work on DRY coding. I write everything out and it ends up being pretty long...
